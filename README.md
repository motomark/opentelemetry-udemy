# OpenTelemetry Observability For Java Spring Boot Developers

This intensive course is designed for **experienced Java Spring Boot Developers** ready to transition into a **Staff or Principal Engineer role**.

You will master **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**, the universal cloud-native standard for instrumentation, and gain the **architectural expertise** to implement **world-class observability** in complex distributed systems.

Move beyond basic monitoring. Learn to collect, correlate, analyze, and visualize the three pillars of modern observability: **Distributed Traces, Metrics, and Logs** to debug production issues faster, preempt system failures, and build highly reliable, scalable applications.

## What You Will Maser

1.  **Observability Fundamentals:** Go beyond traditional monitoring by understanding the **Three Pillars: Distributed Traces, Metrics, and Logs** and their role in diagnosing unknown system issues.
2.  **Zero-Code Instrumentation:** Instantly gain full-stack visibility by deploying the **OpenTelemetry Java Agent** for seamless auto-instrumentation on your Spring Boot microservices.
3.  **End-to-End Trace Context:** Master **W3C Trace Context Propagation** and **Baggage** to accurately link requests and business context across all services in your distributed architecture.
4.  **Custom Business Spans:** Manually inject **custom Spans and Attributes** into your Java code to capture rich, domain-specific data points critical for root cause analysis.
5.  **The OTel Collector Pipeline:** Configure and deploy the **OpenTelemetry Collector** to receive, process, filter, and export all telemetry data using the high-performance **OTLP** (OpenTelemetry Protocol).
6.  **Full Observability Stack:** Deploy a complete, open-source backend using **Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo, and Loki** with Docker Compose to store, query, and visualize all collected OTel data.
7.  **Log-Trace Correlation:** Integrate structured Java/Spring logs with OpenTelemetry to instantly connect raw log messages to their full transaction history.
8.  **Cost-Effective Sampling:** Implement smart **Head- and Tail-Based Sampling** strategies to control observability data volume and storage costs without sacrificing critical error traces.
9.  **Analyze & Reduce MTTR:** Utilize aggregated telemetry signals (Traces, Metrics, Logs) to quickly find root causes, pinpoint performance bottlenecks, and drastically reduce **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**.
10. **On Demand Debugging:** Build reusable, production-grade observability components for **on-demand debugging** and and bring observability earlier into the development workflow.

By the end of this course, you will be able to instrument your Spring Boot applications with OpenTelemetry, gain deep visibility into distributed systems, debug issues with clarity, and strengthen your career as an advanced engineer.
